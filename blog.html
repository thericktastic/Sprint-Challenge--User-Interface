            <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you
                know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most
                times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because
                of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.</p>

                <p>Make the site responsive. It'll take 24-48 hours to propagate. Why can't we use Git instead of SVN? I
                    want a third monitor. We're going to try Agile instead of Waterfall this time. Their current site is
                    in ColdFusion.</p>
                <br>
                <p>No, we're not going to build it in Flash. What would DHH do? I want one of those exercise-ball
                    chairs. We forgot to install the Google Analytics code.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We need a bigger QA budget. It'll take 24-48 hours to propagate. My MacBook died. I didn't see
                    your
                    IM while I was in Linux. I'll get you my timesheet later. Their current site is in ColdFusion.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>What would DHH do? It's almost done! Twitter just changed their API again! Don't worry, this is
                    just
                    the MVP version. I want one of those exercise-ball chairs.</p>
